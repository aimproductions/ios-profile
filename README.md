*This project is a part of The [SOOMLA](http://project.soom.la) Framework which is a series of open source initiatives with a joint goal to help mobile game developers do more together. SOOMLA encourages better game designing, economy modeling and faster development.*

Haven't you ever wanted an in-app purchase one liner that looks like this ?!

```objective-c
    [[SoomlaProfile getInstance] updateStatusWithProvider:FACEBOOK
                                 andStatus:@"I Love This GAME !"
                                 andReward:appDelegate.updateStatusReward];
```

*SOOMLA's Profile Module for iOS*

**android-profile** is an open code initiative as part of The SOOMLA Project. It is a Objective-C API that unifies interaction with social and identity providers APIs, and optionally ties it together with the game's virtual economy.
This enables to easily reward players with social actions they perform in-game, and leveraging user profiles.

Getting Started
---

#### **WE USE ARC !**

1. The static libs and headers you need are in the folder [build](https://github.com/soomla/ios-profile/tree/master/build).

  * Set your project's "Library Search Paths" and "Header Search Paths" to that folder.
  * Add `-ObjC -lSoomlaiOSProfile -lSoomlaiOSCore` to the project's "Other Linker Flags".

1. Make sure you have the following frameworks in your application's project: **Security, libsqlite3.0.dylib**.

1. Initialize **Soomla** with a secret that you chose to encrypt the user data. (For those who came from older versions, this should be the same as the old "custom secret"):

    ```objective-c
     [Soomla initializeWithSecret:@"[YOUR CUSTOM GAME SECRET HERE]"];
    ```
> The secret is your encryption secret for data saved in the DB.

1. If integrating with virtual economy module, please see [ios-store](https://github.com/soomla/ios-store) for store setup.

1. Refer to the [next section](https://github.com/soomla/ios-profile#whats-next-selecting-social-providers) for information of selecting social providers and setting them up.

1. Access the Profile functionality through `SoomlaProfile`

    ```objective-c
      [[SoomlaProfile getInstance] ...]
    ```

And that's it ! You have social network capabilities capabilities.

## What's next? Selecting Social Providers

**ios-profile** is structured to support multiple social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), at the time of writing this the framework only supports Facebook integration.

### Facebook

Facebook is supported out-of-the-box you just have to follow the next steps to make it work:

1. Add the Facebook SDK for iOS to the project's Frameworks and make sure your project links to the project

1. Refer to [Getting Started with the Facebook iOS SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/) for more information

## UserProfile

As part of a login call to a provider, Soomla will internally try to also fetch the online user profile details via
`UserProfile` and store them in the secure [Soomla Storage](https://github.com/soomla/ios-store#storage--meta-data)
Later, this can be retrieved locally (in offline mode) via:

```objective-c
  UserProfile *userProfile = [[SoomlaProfile getInstance] getStoredUserProfileWithProvider:FACEBOOK];
```

 This can throw a `UserProfileNotFoundException` if something strange happens to the local storage,
 in that case, you need to require a new login to get the `UserProfile` again.

## Rewards feature

One of the big benefits of using Soomla's profile module for social networks interactions is that you can easily tie it in with the game's virtual economy.
This is done by the ability to specify a `Reward` (perhaps more specifically, a `VirtualItemRewrad`) to most social actions defined in `SoomlaProfile`.

For example, to reward a user with a "sword" virtual item upon login to Facebook:

  ```objective-c
    Reward *reward = [[VirtualItemReward alloc] initWithRewardId:@"..."
                                                andName:@"Update Status for sword"
                                                andAmount:1
                                                andAssociatedItemId:@"sword"];
    [[SoomlaProfile getInstance] loginWithProvider:FACEBOOK andReward:reward];
  ```

  Once login completes sucessfully (wait for `EVENT_UP_LOGIN_FINISHED`), the
  reward will be automatically given, and synchronized with Soomla's storage.

  The reward id is something you manage and should be unique, much like virtual items.


## Debugging

In order to debug ios-profile, set `DEBUG_LOG` (see [SoomlaConfig](https://github.com/soomla/soomla-ios-core/blob/master/SoomlaiOSCore/SoomlaConfig.m)) to `YES`. This will print all of _ios-profile's_ debugging messages to Log Navigator.

## Storage

The on-device storage is encrypted and kept in a SQLite database. SOOMLA is preparing a cloud-based storage service that will allow this SQLite to be synced to a cloud-based repository that you'll define.

Security
---

If you want to protect your application from 'bad people' (and who doesn't?!), you might want to follow some guidelines:

+ SOOMLA keeps the game's data in an encrypted database. In order to encrypt your data, SOOMLA generates a private key out of several parts of information. Soomla's secret (before v3.4.0 is was known as custom secret) is one of them. SOOMLA recommends that you change this value before you release your game. BE CAREFUL: You can change this value once! If you try to change it again, old data from the database will become unavailable.


Event Handling
---

SOOMLA lets you get notifications on various events and implement your own application specific behavior.

> Your behavior is an addition to the default behavior implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behavior.

In order to observe store events you need to import EventHandling.h and then you can add a notification to *NSNotificationCenter*:

  ```objective-c
  [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(yourCustomSelector:) name:EVENT_UP_LOGIN_STARTED object:nil];
  ```

OR, you can observe all events with the same selector by calling:

  ```objective-c
  [UserProfileEventHandling observeAllEventsWithObserver:self withSelector:@selector(yourCustomSelector:)];
  ```

## Example Project

The **ios-profile** project contains an [example project](https://github.com/soomla/ios-profile/tree/master/SoomlaiOSProfileExample) which shows most of the functionality Profile provides, and the correct setup.
In order to run the project follow this steps:

1. NOTE: The example project is dependent upon [ios-store](https://github.com/soomla/ios-store) and assumes the project is cloned in a sibling folder to **ios-profile**. Refer to [ios-store](https://github.com/soomla/ios-store) on instructions on how to clone the project
1. Open the `SoomlaiOSProfileExample.xcodeproj` project in XCode
1. Run the project on Simulator or on Device
